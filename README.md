# Clock app

I remember when I started learning javascript, I decided that APIs were my number 1 enemy. Needless to say, the reason was that I still didn't quite understand how they worked. To fully understand and appreciate them, I had to wait to start using react.

So here is a very simple project (with a questionable design) to exorcise the fear start for API: a simple and fully responsive clock app which displays the current time, the day of the week and the general weather. The APIs used are worldtimeapi and openweathermap.
